**inÂ·fraÂ·strucÂ·ture/ËˆinfrÉ™ËŒstrÉ™k(t)SHÉ™r/**

    1. the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.

*O1 Labs is an open, decentralized and managed infrastructure/operations service platform dedicated to the development, provisioning and support of ALL things cloud-native and web3.*

Ranging from cloud-native services/applications (e.g. `prometheus, kafka, fluentd`) to blockchain network nodes and validators to an assortment of development and operational environments (e.g. `git, vim, tmux`), **O1** strives to enhance all technological ecosystems with encoded expert & experienced operational logic and insights via the most established and developed software automation tools, human-computer vizualization and interaction technques and best practices - crafted and curated by a world-wide community of researchers, developers, operators and hobbyists/enthusiasts.

Manifested as Dockerfiles, Helm charts, Ansible roles/collections and React/D3.js components, built by O1 and everyone else (+ a steadfast dedication rooted at the project's core to the latest and greatest tools involved in infrastructure automation, machine-learning and HCI), our infrastructure aims to literally escalate the idea of infrastructure providers to the :cloud: by building decentralized DevOps interfaces and platforms which provide evolved and sophisticated user-experiences pushing the boundary of the capabilities ofthe modern web; leaving behind the dark, archaic CLI and terminal days in the rearview.
