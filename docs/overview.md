# Project Overview and Design Specification

## What is O1?

### an open, decentralized software infrastructure platform focused on supporting blockchain/web3 and cloud-native technologies
  - can technically manage the deployment of 10s of thousands of web3, cloud-native and devops applications available across major public
    Ansible role and Dockerhub repositories (including open-source standards developed by O1 Labs)
  - is also capable of managing the deployments of the above package types sourced from private repositories as well as public or private non-virtualized, standalone binaries using the full potential of Systemd
  - the O1 Labs application offerings enable the complete SDLC (Software Deployment Lifecycle, in this case) from:
  
  #### installation->configuration->launch->observability->uninstallation

### a decentralized open-source UserInterface-as-a-Service platform

#### built to optimize the human-computer interface between the myriad of aforementioned software applications and technologies and all types of human users
  - currently supports a file and web-based interface which includes a REST API (Application Programming Interface) for observing and modifying application state and associated metadata
  - supports programmatic orchestration of these services and applications using any programming language
  - achieves parity with existing CLI tooling in that any CLI program can be executed securely against/on any controlled node with captured output returned for processing
  - sets the stage for a modern web-based UI, perhaps built on top of React and d3.js, which supports a decentralized marketplace of community crafted user-interfaces which can be installed/uninstalled as easy as on an iPhone/Android App
